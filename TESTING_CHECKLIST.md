# XLS Converter - Pre-Launch Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive testing plan to verify all functionality before launching the XLS Converter project.

## 1. Environment Setup

- [ ] Install all dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- [ ] Verify Node.js version compatibility (v14+ recommended)
- [ ] Check if all required files exist
- [ ] Ensure environment variables are properly set (JWT_SECRET if needed)

## 2. Unit Tests

- [ ] Run unit tests for the converter module:
  ```
  npx vitest run test/unit/converter.test.js
  ```
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Check test coverage reports:
  ```
  npx vitest run --coverage
  ```

## 3. Integration Tests

- [ ] Run integration tests for the server API:
  ```
  npx vitest run test\integration\server.test.js
  ```
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints function correctly
- [ ] Test authentication and security features
- [ ] Test error handling and edge cases

## 5. Standalone Tests

- [ ] Run standalone test script:
  ```
  node standalone-test.js
  ```
- [ ] Verify all test cases run successfully
- [ ] Check output files in the standalone-test-output directory

## 6. Server Testing

- [ ] Start the server:
  ```
  node src/server/index.js
  ```
- [ ] Test health check endpoint: http://localhost:3000/health
- [ ] Test API documentation endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api-docs
- [ ] Test the conversion endpoint with various file formats using Postman or curl

## 7. Browser Demo Testing

- [ ] Open the browser demo in a web browser:
  ```
  # Using a simple HTTP server
  npx serve src/client
  ```
- [ ] Test file upload with various formats (XLS, XLSX, CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Verify successful conversion and download
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid files
- [ ] Test with large files to verify performance

## 8. Examples Testing

- [ ] Test Node.js example:
  ```
  node examples/node/convert-file.js
  ```
- [ ] Verify output files are created correctly
- [ ] Check if the example handles errors properly

- [ ] Test browser example:
  ```
  npx serve examples/browser
  ```
- [ ] Verify client-side conversion works with various formats
- [ ] Test error handling and UI feedback

## 9. Documentation Review

- [ ] Review README.md for correctness and completeness
- [ ] Verify API documentation in docs/api.md
- [ ] Check security guidelines in docs/security.md
- [ ] Review browser integration guide in docs/browser.md
- [ ] Validate comparison document in docs/comparison.md
- [ ] Check usage documentation in docs/usage.md
- [ ] Verify "why it exists" document in docs/why.md

## 10. Security Auditing

- [ ] Test formula stripping functionality with malicious formulas
- [ ] Verify JWT authentication works correctly
- [ ] Check file size validation
- [ ] Test MIME type validation
- [ ] Verify temporary file cleanup works properly
- [ ] Check for any potential security vulnerabilities

## 11. Performance Benchmarking

- [ ] Test with large files (10MB+)
- [ ] Measure and record conversion time
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during conversion
- [ ] Compare results with benchmarks in the comparison document

## 12. Cross-Browser Testing

- [ ] Test browser demo in Chrome
- [ ] Test in Firefox
- [ ] Test in Safari
- [ ] Test in Edge
- [ ] Verify mobile browser compatibility

## 13. Error Recovery

- [ ] Test handling of corrupted files
- [ ] Verify error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Check API error responses contain proper status codes and information
- [ ] Test recovery from network interruptions

## Results and Issues Tracking
