# XLS Converter Project Code of Conduct

## The Short Version

Be professional, be respectful, be pragmatic. We're here to build great software.

## Our Principles

- **Focus on the code**: Quality comes first
- **Be direct but respectful**: Clear communication is valued, rudeness is not
- **Assume competence**: Everyone has something valuable to contribute
- **Solve problems**: Focus on solutions, not personalities or politics
- **Give and accept feedback gracefully**: Critique the code, not the person
- **Stay on topic**: Keep discussions relevant to the project

## What We Expect

- Technical discussions based on merit and evidence
- Constructive feedback focused on improving the project
- Respect for different skill levels, perspectives, and individuals
- Professional conduct in all project-related communications
- Collaboration that moves the project forward

## What We Won't Tolerate

- Harassment or discriminatory behavior
- Personal attacks or trolling
- Spam, excessive self-promotion, or disruption
- Violations of intellectual property rights
- Actions that compromise project security

## Resolution Process

If issues arise:

1. Try direct, private communication first
2. If that fails, escalate to project maintainers
3. Maintainers will review and take appropriate action
4. Focus is on finding solutions, not assigning blame

## The Bottom Line

We're a community working on code. Good technical contributions from respectful participants are always welcome, regardless of background or identity.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and represents official policy.
